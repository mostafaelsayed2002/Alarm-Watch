# Alarm Watch Project

---

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop an alarm watch using STM32 microcontrollers (STM32F446RE and STM32F103C8T6) along with essential components like an RTC module, LCD display, LEDs, and a buzzer. The watch will support displaying, setting, and managing time, date, and alarms, as well as incorporating a secure login system for user interaction.
